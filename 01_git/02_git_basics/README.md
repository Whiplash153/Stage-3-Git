# Task 2 — Git Basics: Status, Diff, Log, Show

## Goal
Understand how Git tracks changes through the working directory, staging area, and commit history. Learn to view modifications, prepare changes for commits, inspect history, and examine specific commits in detail.

## What was done
The task introduced key Git inspection tools:
- `git status` to view current repository state.
- `git diff` to inspect changes in the working directory.
- `git add` to move changes into the staging area.
- `git diff --staged` to inspect staged changes.
- `git commit` to save changes into the repository history.
- `git log` to explore commit history.
- `git show` to inspect the contents and details of a specific commit.

During the task, a new file was created, modified, added to staging, committed, and examined through several Git commands. Multiple commits were inspected to observe how Git presents history and file-level differences.

## Notes
This task reinforces the core workflow of Git:
1. Modify files (working directory).
2. Stage changes (index).
3. Commit to history (repository).
4. Inspect differences and commit metadata.
