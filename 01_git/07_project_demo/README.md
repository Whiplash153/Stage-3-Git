# Mini Git Project: Feature Branch Workflow

## Goal
To practice a realistic Git workflow using feature branches, clean commits, and fast-forward merges in a small demo project.

## What Was Done
- Created a minimal project structure with a calculator module.
- Implemented `add()`, `subtract()`, and `multiply()` functions in separate feature branches.
- Performed clean fast-forward merges back into the `main` branch.
- Removed feature branches after merging to maintain a tidy repository.
- Verified the commit history to ensure a linear and readable structure.

## Key Concepts
- Feature branches isolate changes and keep the `main` branch stable.
- Fast-forward merges are used when no divergent work exists.
- Each unit of work should be committed with a clear message.
- Removing merged branches keeps the repository clean.
