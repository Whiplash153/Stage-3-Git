Task: Markdown — Code & Blocks

Goal:
Learn how to format code inside Markdown documents using inline code,
fenced code blocks, syntax highlighting, blockquotes, and nested elements.

What was done:
1. Created example.md for practicing Markdown code formatting.
2. Added inline code using single backticks.
3. Added fenced code blocks using triple backticks.
4. Added syntax highlighting for Python code blocks.
5. Added blockquotes and nested code blocks inside quotes.
6. Added mixed content: text, lists, inline code, and multi-line code.

Result:
example.md now contains all essential Markdown patterns for documenting code.
These patterns will be reused in future tasks and README files.
