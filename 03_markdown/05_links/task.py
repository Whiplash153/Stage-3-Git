Task: Markdown — Links & References

Goal:
Learn how to create and use different types of links in Markdown, including
basic links, title links, reference-style links, internal anchors, local file links,
email links, and raw GitHub download URLs.

What was done:
1. Added basic Markdown links with direct URLs.
2. Added links with title attributes.
3. Implemented reference-style links with a separate definition block.
4. Added internal anchor navigation inside the same file.
5. Linked to local repository files using relative paths.
6. Added email-style links using the mailto: scheme.
7. Added example of raw GitHub links for direct file access.

Result:
example.md now contains all major link formats used in documentation,
README files, and technical writing.
