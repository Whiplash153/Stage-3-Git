Task: Markdown — Images

Goal:
Learn how to insert images into Markdown documents using local files,
URL images, titles, and HTML tags for resizing.

What was done:
1. Added a local image (1.png) and referenced it with a relative path.
2. Added an external image using a URL.
3. Added an image with a title attribute.
4. Added an HTML <img> tag to control image size.
5. Included notes about how Markdown handles image paths and formatting.

Result:
example.md now demonstrates all major methods of displaying images
inside Markdown, useful for README files, documentation, and tutorials.
