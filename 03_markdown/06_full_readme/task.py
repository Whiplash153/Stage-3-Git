Task: Markdown — Full README Structure

Goal:
Create a complete professional README template covering the sections commonly
used in real projects: title, description, features, installation, usage,
project structure, examples, configuration, contributing, and license.

What was done:
1. Created a full README layout inside example.md.
2. Used safe Markdown formatting without triple backticks to avoid rendering issues.
3. Added installation instructions, usage examples, project tree, and config notes.
4. Included contributing guidelines and license placeholder.
5. Ensured the template is reusable for future projects.

Result:
example.md now serves as a universal README template that can be copied into
any new repository. The formatting is stable across GitHub, PyCharm, and other viewers.
