Task: Markdown Basics

Goal:
Learn the basic Markdown syntax used in documentation: headings,
text formatting, lists, links, horizontal rules, and inline code.

What was done:
1. Created the file example.md for practicing Markdown.
2. Added examples of headings (#, ##, ###).
3. Added text formatting: italic, bold, bold italic.
4. Created unordered and ordered lists.
5. Added a hyperlink using Markdown syntax.
6. Added a horizontal rule and inline code examples.

Result:
The file example.md now demonstrates all essential Markdown basics,
which can be reused later when writing documentation and README files.
