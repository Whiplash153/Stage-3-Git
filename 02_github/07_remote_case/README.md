# Remote GitHub Workflow Case

## Goal
Practice the complete GitHub workflow used in real development:
feature branches, pull requests, remote merges, conflict resolution,
and syncing local work with the remote repository.

## Process
- Created a small case project with a feature file.
- Implemented the first feature in a dedicated branch and merged it via GitHub.
- Synced the local `main` branch with the updated remote state.
- Created two additional branches that modified the same file differently.
- Merged the first of these branches normally.
- Opened a pull request for the second one and triggered a merge conflict.
- Resolved the conflict through GitHub’s conflict editor and completed the merge.
- Pulled the final resolved `main` branch locally.

## Key Concepts
- Pull Request workflow
- Remote merge behavior
- Conflicts between branches
- Conflict resolution via GitHub interface
- Synchronization of local and remote `main`
