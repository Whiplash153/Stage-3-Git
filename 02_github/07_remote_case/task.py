Task: Remote Case — Full GitHub Workflow

Goal:
Simulate a real-world team workflow using GitHub:
working with branches, making pull requests, handling conflicts,
and synchronizing local and remote states.

What was done:
1. Created a mini-project inside the case directory.
2. Made the first feature branch (feature/remote-case-1), added a file,
   committed the changes, and pushed the branch to GitHub.
3. Opened a Pull Request and merged it through GitHub.
4. Updated the local main branch to synchronize with remote changes.
5. Created a second feature branch (case3) and modified the same file.
   Committed and pushed the branch, opened a PR, and merged it.
6. Created a third branch (case4) with different conflicting changes
   to the same file and pushed it to GitHub.
7. Opened a PR for the conflicting branch and triggered a merge conflict.
8. Resolved the conflict using GitHub’s interface and completed the merge.
9. Updated local main again to pull the final resolved version.

Result:
The full remote workflow was completed:
PR creation, review, merging, conflict handling, and synchronization
between local and remote repositories.
