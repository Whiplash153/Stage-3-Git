# Git Clone Task

## Goal
Learn how to properly clone a repository from GitHub, verify the remote configuration, and ensure that the cloned copy works as a fully independent development environment.

## What was done
- Created a separate folder (`clone_demo`) to simulate a new machine.
- Cloned the `Stage-3-Git` repository using `git clone`.
- Verified the `origin` remote settings.
- Created a new branch (`clone/test`) inside the cloned repo.
- Added a test file and made a commit.
- Pushed the new branch to GitHub to confirm that the cloned environment can sync with the remote repository.

## Key concepts
- `git clone` creates a complete copy of the repository, including history and branches.
- The cloned repo is fully independent and can be used on any machine.
- Proper remote configuration allows pushing and pulling from GitHub without issues.
