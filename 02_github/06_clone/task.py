Task: Repository Cloning (git clone)

Goal:
Learn how to correctly clone a GitHub repository, set up a fresh working environment,
verify remote configuration, and confirm that the cloned copy can push and pull changes
just like the original local project.

What was done:
1. Created a separate directory (`clone_demo`) to simulate a new machine.
2. Cloned the GitHub repository `Stage-3-Git` using `git clone`.
3. Verified the remote settings (`origin`) to ensure the clone is linked to GitHub.
4. Created a new branch (`clone/test`) inside the cloned repository.
5. Added a small test file and committed the changes.
6. Pushed the new branch to GitHub to confirm that the cloned repo can sync with the remote.

Result:
The cloned repository works as a fully functional environment.
All Git operations (branching, committing, pushing, pulling) behave exactly the same
as in the original local repository.
