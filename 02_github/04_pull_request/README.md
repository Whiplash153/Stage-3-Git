# Pull Request Practice

## Goal
Learn how to create, submit, review, and merge a Pull Request on GitHub as part of a standard collaborative development workflow.

## What was done
- A feature branch (`feature/pr-demo`) was created from `main`.
- Changes were added and committed inside the task directory.
- The branch was pushed to GitHub with upstream tracking.
- A Pull Request was opened using GitHub’s interface.
- The diff was reviewed in the “Files changed” tab and a comment was added.
- The PR was merged into `main` through GitHub’s merge tools.
- The feature branch was deleted after the merge to keep the repository clean.

## Key concepts
- PR is the main mechanism for proposing changes in collaborative work.
- GitHub allows reviewing diffs, commenting, and discussing changes.
- The merge step finalizes the integration of the feature branch.
- Deleting merged feature branches prevents repository clutter.
